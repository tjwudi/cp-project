Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . h1
    (1) h1 -> . H1OPEN plain H1CLOSE

    H1OPEN          shift and go to state 2

    h1                             shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> h1 .



state 2

    (1) h1 -> H1OPEN . plain H1CLOSE
    (2) plain -> . PLAIN

    PLAIN           shift and go to state 4

    plain                          shift and go to state 3

state 3

    (1) h1 -> H1OPEN plain . H1CLOSE

    H1CLOSE         shift and go to state 5


state 4

    (2) plain -> PLAIN .

    H1CLOSE         reduce using rule 2 (plain -> PLAIN .)


state 5

    (1) h1 -> H1OPEN plain H1CLOSE .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (h1 -> H1OPEN plain H1CLOSE .)
